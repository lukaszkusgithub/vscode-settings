# Backup and Restore Visual Studio Code Settings and Extensions

This guide explains how to backup your Visual Studio Code settings and extensions to GitHub and restore them when needed.

## Backup Instructions

### 1. Export Settings and Keybindings
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to:
   - `File` (or `Code` on macOS) â†’ `Preferences` â†’ `Settings`.
   - Click the icon to open the settings JSON file.
3. Save the `settings.json` file.
4. Navigate to:
   - `Preferences` â†’ `Keyboard Shortcuts`.
   - Click the icon to open the keybindings JSON file.
5. Save the `keybindings.json` file.

### 2. Export Extensions
Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
code --list-extensions > extensions.txt
```

This command generates a file named `extensions.txt` containing a list of installed extensions.

### 3. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository.
   - Name it something like `vscode-backup`.
   - Set it to public or private as per your preference.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-backup.git
```

### 4. Add Files to the Repository
1. Copy `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, and `extensions.txt` into the cloned repository folder.
2. Optionally, add a `README.md` file with instructions.
3. Commit and push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository folder
cd vscode-backup

# Add files
git add settings.json keybindings.json extensions.txt

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Backup VS Code settings and extensions"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
